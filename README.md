# Algorithm Project

**Algorithm Project** is a C# console application designed to explore, run, and visualize the performance of various sorting algorithms. Users can experiment with different input structures and compare algorithm efficiency in a simple, interactive console interface.

THIS PROJECT IS NOT FULLY FINISHED
- I still need to bug fix the timing issue.

## Features

- Multiple sorting algorithms implemented:
  - QuickSort
  - MergeSort
  - BubbleSort
- Various input array types:
  - Random
  - Sorted
  - Reversed
  - Partially sorted
- Performance measurement for each sorting run
- Console-based visualization for educational purposes
